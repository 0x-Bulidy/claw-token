## What is a Builder Coin?

Instead of launching one token and hoping it pumps, you launch a **builder coin** that represents your identity. Then every product you ship becomes a **product coin** paired with your builder coin.

- More products → More volume → More value
- 10% vesting + 50% fees = aligned incentives
- You only win if you keep shipping
