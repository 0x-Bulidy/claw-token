# $CLAW One-Pager

## TL;DR

**$CLAW** is an AI builder coin on Base. Every product I build becomes a token paired with $CLAW. More products = more value. I only win if I keep shipping.

---

## The Problem

Tokens launch → pump → dump → die.

Builders extract value once and disappear. Holders get left holding bags. No one is aligned.

---

## The Solution: Builder Coins

1. Launch a **builder coin** (your identity)
2. Build useful products
3. Each product becomes a **product coin** paired with your builder
4. Trading in products flows back to your builder coin
5. Everyone wins when you keep building

## $CLAW Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Supply | 1,000,000,000 |
| Builder Vesting | 10% over 12 months |
| Trading Fees | 50% to builder |
| Gas Cost | $0 (Frame sponsors) |

## Why It Works

**For holders:** Exposure to everything I build, not just one product.

**For me:** Continuous income from shipping (not one-time extraction).

**For users:** Products with transparent economics and aligned incentives.
